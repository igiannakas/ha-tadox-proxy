# How It Works

The full story, for people who want to know *why* rather than just *how*.

You do not need any of this to use the integration. Nothing here is required
reading, and nothing here asks you to change a setting. It is written for the
curious, and for anyone thinking about contributing to the code.

Every technical term is explained the first time it appears.

## The problem, physically

A Tado X screws onto the radiator valve. Its temperature sensor is therefore a few
centimetres from a hot metal surface.

When the radiator runs, the air around it might sit at 24 °C while the middle of the
room is at 20 °C. The Tado sees 24, decides the room is comfortably above your
target, and closes the valve. The room never gets there.

This is not a defect. It is where the sensor has to be, given that the device is a
valve head. Every radiator thermostat with a built-in sensor has this problem to some
degree. Tado X just happens to have it noticeably, and offers no way to feed it an
external reading.

The gap is typically **1 to 3 °C**, and it is not constant. It depends on how hard
the radiator is running, how the room is laid out, and where the air moves.

---

## The idea: lie about the target, not about the temperature

The obvious fix would be to take over the valve — ignore Tado's own logic and control
the opening directly. That is not possible here, and it would also be a shame: Tado's
internal controller is decent at what it does, and it keeps working when Home
Assistant is down.

So this integration does something less invasive. **It leaves Tado in charge and
changes the number Tado is aiming for.**

You want 21 °C in the room. The integration works out that Tado needs to be told
something like 23 °C for the room to actually land at 21. So it sends 23. Tado runs
its own control loop against that number, exactly as it always did, and the room
ends up where you wanted it.

This is the whole trick, and it has a pleasant side effect: if this integration ever
stops running, your heating does not stop. It simply goes back to behaving like a
plain Tado, with the last target it was given.

---

## Working out the number

Three parts are added to your requested temperature. Each has a different job.

### Part 1: Feedforward — correcting a known, measurable error

Imagine a thermometer that always reads 2 °C too high. Once you know that, you do not
need clever mathematics. You just add 2.

That is feedforward: correcting an error you can *measure directly*, before it has a
chance to cause a problem.

The integration knows both readings — what Tado reports and what your room sensor
reports. The difference between them is the error, right now, no guessing:

```
feedforward_offset = tado_reading − room_reading
```

If Tado says 23.5 and your sensor says 21.8, the offset is 1.7 °C. So the integration
adds 1.7 to your target and sends that.

**This is the main correction.** It typically does 80–90 % of the work. It also
reacts instantly: when the radiator gets hotter and the gap widens, the offset widens
with it in the same cycle. There is no waiting, no settling, no learning period.

The two parts that follow only clean up what feedforward leaves behind.

### Part 2: Proportional — reacting to the gap right now

Feedforward corrects the sensor. It does not know whether the room is actually at the
temperature you asked for. Heat losses through walls and windows, a draught, an open
door — these all mean the room can sit below target even when the sensor offset is
perfectly handled.

So the second part looks at the **error**: how far the room is from what you asked for.

```
error = your_target − room_temperature
p_correction = Kp × error
```

`Kp` is just a strength dial, default 0.8. Room 0.5 °C too cold, so push the target
0.4 °C higher. Simple and immediate.

Proportional control has a known weakness: it only acts while an error exists. A room
that settles a little too cold produces a small correction forever, and stays a little
too cold forever. Which brings us to part three.

### Part 3: Integral — remembering a persistent shortfall

The third part is memory. It accumulates the error over time:

```
integral += error × Ki × seconds_elapsed
```

If your room sits 0.2 °C too cold for an hour, the integral quietly grows and pushes
the target up until the shortfall is gone. It is what turns "close enough" into
"actually right".

`Ki` is deliberately tiny — 0.003. This part is meant to work over tens of minutes,
not seconds.

### Putting it together

```
target_sent_to_tado = your_target
                    + feedforward_offset      (the sensor gap, measured)
                    + Kp × error              (react to now)
                    + integral                (remember the persistent part)
```

The result is clamped to 5–30 °C so a strange sensor reading can never send an absurd
command.

You can watch all four numbers live in **Developer Tools → States** on your proxy
entity. They are listed in the
[settings reference](settings.md#diagnostic-attributes).

## Why the numbers are so small

`Kp = 0.8` and `Ki = 0.003` look timid next to textbook controller values. That is
intentional, and it is a consequence of what is being controlled.

A radiator is slow. Open the valve and nothing happens for several minutes: the water
has to arrive, the metal has to warm, the air has to circulate. From valve to felt
temperature is easily 15–30 minutes.

Controlling something slow with an aggressive controller always ends the same way. The
controller sees no response, pushes harder, sees no response, pushes harder still —
and by the time all that heat finally lands, the room sails past the target. Then it
overcorrects the other way. The room oscillates, permanently.

The defence is patience, plus the fact that feedforward already handles the bulk of
the correction. The PI part is only cleaning up a small residue, so it does not need
to be strong.

**If you take one thing from this page:** turning Kp up is almost never the fix.
Rooms that heat too slowly are usually undersized radiators or a sensor in a bad spot.

## Two problems worth knowing about

### Integral windup

The integral has a dangerous failure mode, and it happens exactly when you would
least want it to.

Picture a cold start. The room is 4 °C below target. The error is large and stays
large for half an hour — not because the heating is too weak, but because rooms take
time. A naive integral reads that half hour as "still not enough" and accumulates a
huge correction. When the room finally arrives, all of it is still in there, pushing.
The room overshoots badly and takes an hour to come back down.

This is called *windup*, and it is the classic way a PI controller ruins a heating
system.

Two defences are used here:

1. **Only accumulate near the target.** The integral grows only when the error is
   inside a narrow band (default 0.3 °C). Outside that band it does not just stop —
   it *decays*, losing 5 % per cycle. This is the important one. It means the
   integral simply does not participate in heat-up, which is precisely where it would
   cause harm. Its job is fine adjustment once you have arrived.

2. **Freeze while saturated.** If the command has already been clamped at 30 °C, more
   integral would achieve nothing except a debt to be paid off later. So while the
   output is pinned at a limit and the error still points that way, accumulation stops.

The accumulated value is also hard-limited to ±2 °C, as a last line of defence.

### One setting, two conflicting jobs

`Kp` has to serve two situations that want opposite things.

Heating a cold room wants a large `Kp`: push hard, get there quickly. Holding a room
steady wants a small `Kp`: react gently, do not oscillate around the target.

Picking one value means accepting a compromise that is wrong in both situations.

**Gain scheduling** removes the compromise by making `Kp` depend on the situation:

| How far off | Multiplier | Why |
|---|---|---|
| More than 2 °C | × 1.5 | Cold start. Push hard |
| Between 0.5 and 2 °C | slides smoothly | No sudden jump in behaviour |
| Less than 0.5 °C | × 1.0 | Nearly there. Be gentle |

It is the same instinct you use driving: firm on the accelerator when you are far
from the speed you want, feathering it as you approach.

The transition is a linear slide rather than a step, because a controller whose
behaviour jumps at a threshold produces visible kinks in the temperature curve.

All four values are adjustable, and the whole feature can be switched off if you have
already tuned `Kp` to your liking.

## Why it waits three minutes

Commands to the thermostat are rate-limited: at most one every 180 seconds by default.

Tado X thermostats are wireless and battery powered. Every command is a radio
transmission, and radio is by far the most expensive thing the device does. A
controller that sent an update every 30 seconds would work beautifully and eat
batteries in a season.

Three minutes costs almost nothing in control quality, because — as established
above — the radiator needs far longer than that to respond anyway. You are not
losing precision. You are declining to spend battery on precision the physics
cannot deliver.

Two refinements soften the edges:

- **A minimum change threshold** (0.3 °C). Differences smaller than this are not
  worth a transmission, since Tado rounds to 0.1 °C steps anyway.
- **An urgent bypass.** If the target needs to drop by more than 1 °C — you opened a
  window, or switched to Away — the wait is skipped. Making a room too hot is
  uncomfortable and wastes energy, so *stopping* heat is allowed to be immediate even
  though *adding* it is not.

---

## When the sensor disappears

The whole design rests on the external sensor. If it stops reporting, the feedforward
offset cannot be calculated and the integration is blind.

Sensors do drop out, especially over Zigbee — a missed message, a busy network, a
flat battery.

The response is graded rather than all-or-nothing:

- **Short gap** (under 5 minutes by default): carry on with the last valid reading.
  A room does not change much in five minutes, so this is a reasonable bet, and it
  beats abandoning control for a hiccup. `binary_sensor.*_sensor_degraded` turns on
  so the state is visible rather than silent.
- **Longer gap:** stop correcting. Continuing to control on a reading that may now be
  an hour old would be worse than doing nothing. Tado keeps running on the last target
  it was given, which is a safe place to land.

Pending window and presence actions are re-validated immediately before they fire, so
a single spurious reading during a timer cannot flip a room into Away.

Window mode is entered once per opening. A repeated "open" report while it is already
active (for example a sensor that drops to `unavailable` and comes back `on`) is
ignored, so the preset saved when the window first opened is never overwritten by
Frost Protection itself.

The window, presence and boost state (active or not, the preset to return to, and
when a boost ends) is stored with the entity's restore data. After a restart or a
config-entry reload the controllers are re-armed from it and then checked against the
sensors: a window that closed while Home Assistant was down restores the saved preset
at once; one that is still open (or not reported yet) stays in window mode. Without
this, the only clue after a restart would be the preset name, and a Frost Protection
the user chose could not be told apart from one the window automation set.

Summer mode sits above all of this. While its switch is on, the regulation cycle is
replaced by a simple check: is the TRV in heat mode at 5 °C? If not, the command is
sent again (subject to the normal rate limit; only the command sent when summer mode
turns on skips it). Room-sensor data is not needed. Service calls that would change
the proxy raise an error, and the unchanged state is written with `force_update` so
the frontend drops the value it showed optimistically. Only a definite `on`/`off`
from the switch changes the lock. `unavailable` is ignored, and the lock is part of
the stored restore data.

## Design decisions, briefly

**Why not a full PID?** The D (derivative) term reacts to how fast the error is
changing. On a system this slow and this noisy — a sensor reporting in 0.1 °C steps
every few minutes — D mostly amplifies measurement noise. There is nothing useful for
it to do here.

**Why not control the valve directly?** Not available through the Matter interface,
and it would mean reimplementing what Tado already does adequately. It would also
mean the heating stops working whenever Home Assistant does.

**Why is feedforward the main term rather than the PI?** Because the sensor offset is
*measurable*. Anything you can measure directly, you should correct directly. Feedback
control is for what remains — and the less you leave to it, the more stable the whole
system is.

## Reading the code

If you want to go further, the control logic is deliberately kept free of Home
Assistant dependencies so it can be read and tested on its own:

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `custom_components/tadox_proxy/regulation.py` | The entire control loop, ~200 lines |
| `custom_components/tadox_proxy/parameters.py` | Every default value, with rationale |
| `custom_components/tadox_proxy/climate_controllers.py` | Window, presence and follow state machines |
| `tests/` | Test suite, runnable without Home Assistant |

The formula above corresponds directly to `FeedforwardPiRegulator.compute()`.
